# Hash function benchmarks

This is a simple repository whose only purpose is to benchmark cryptographic hash functions.

It was created to answer the surprisingly common question of how different hash functions compare.

Once you've specified the desired input sizes in the benchmark code, simply run `cargo bench` and enjoy the results.

**WARNING**: This repository is for benchmarking purposes only. It is _not_ intended for production use.
